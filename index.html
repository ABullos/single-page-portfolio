                    <h3> Art </h3>
                        <p> At a young age, I would always watch my mom do her artworks. She does art crafts. I believe I got my artistic side from my mother.
                            I like doing crafts and D.I.Ys. Recently, I have been enjoying painting. It started with watercolor painting but I would like to broaden
                            my horizon and play around with acrylics.

                    <h3> Music </h3>
                    <p>Since at a young age, I have always loved singing. Growing up, I practiced my voice, trying to know more about what songs suits me and what I can do with my voice,
                        how to control it. In highschool, I joined our church's choir. Now, I'm just doing covers of songs.
